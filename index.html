<h1>
  What I Do.
</h1>

<p>
  I'm a <u>Digital Producer</u> working on softwares, website and mobile applications with <a href="http://minitheory.com" target="new">Minitheory</a>. That means I'm the closest non-researcher, non-designer, non-developer to the things being made. I make sure completion at a specific level of quality and fitness through communication and expertise.
</p>
<p>
  I sit objectively in between the project, the client, and the team doing the work. I'm the <u>fastest learner</u> in the room. I bring clarity to all parties by leading the charge but I am never the subject matter expert. In my role, I champion my team’s vision and expertise, my end users' needs, my client’s requirements and my business’s need for profit and control all simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
  When needed, I <u>play or solve</u> for any missing part: code, UX, strategy, testing or design. Check out my <a href="/categories">experiments</a> dabbling in hardware, coding websites, designing apps and one of my many other <a href="/about">interests</a>.
</p>
  Singapore is my home. I brings a strong sense of purpose to my projects and constantly redefines the meaning of “impossible”. I am connected to some of the best people in the industry.
