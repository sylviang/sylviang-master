<h1>
  What I Do.
</h1>

<p>I'm a Digital Producer working on software, website, mobile applications and media storytelling. That means I'm the closest non-researcher, non-designer, non-developer, non-video-editor to the things made. I'm platform agnostic when it comes to storytelling, designing and development. I'm here to guarantee completion at a particular level of quality and fitness.</p>

<p>I sit objectively between the project, the client, and the team doing the work. I'm the fastest learner in the room. I bring clarity to all parties by leading the charge, but I am never the subject matter expert. I champion my team&rsquo;s expertise, my end users' needs, my client&rsquo;s requirements and my business&rsquo;s need for profit. In my role, I control all simultaneously to achieve a fine balance and a great outcome.</p>

<p>When needed, I play or solve for any missing part: code, UX, strategy, testing, design or photography. Check out some of my <a href="/categories">experiments</a> dabbling in hardware, coding websites, designing apps. I have many other <a href="/about">interests</a> and volunteer with initiatives that promotes social good.</p>

<p>If your organisation struggle to connect with people through their devices or the many facets of visual communication, I can help.</p>
