&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The watch is a great complement to my huge ass iPhone 6+. The phone is so bulky that I left it lying around not within reach, or it is kept inside the bag. But my work requires me to response to important messages immediately. When I am waiting or expecting something, instead of having to check my phone every now and then, the notifications and alerts on my wrist tells me if it's what I am expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battery life is decent. A habit of mine is to wear the watch all day even when I am at sleep or in shower. Now that I have to take it out to charge at the end-of-the-day, I think sleep better and more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I silent my phone most of the time and I do not turn on the vibrations because it can be irritating when the phone is vibrating on the desk. At work, I do get call alerts and iMessages on my laptop. But when I am away from desk, the prominent haptic allow me to know when I am about to receive something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never scroll with the crown. Using finger scroll works just as well. Maybe I am used to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love that I get rewarded for activity goals. Not much, but still it is some encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like a fool when I take phone calls from the watch. The speaker is too soft. However, I enjoy texting. It is a quick and easy way to send text messages but weird user experience of having to select the receiver's name and press send.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPS is good. However, when I am riding on my motorbike, I could see the map directions through glances but could not feel the vibrations. Probably due to the crazy vibrations from my dual-purpose scrambler-looking motorbike. Apple maps seems fine for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Made &lt;a href=&quot;http://motoqlik.com&quot;&gt;Motoqlik&lt;/a&gt; with Brandon and friends. It is a motorists social app that we would like to refer to as a revolutionary way for motorists to connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have neglected it since and rather early this month, the app has launched on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motoqlik/id882273536&quot;&gt;iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motoqlik.app&quot;&gt;Android Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m kinda embarrassed about it. But hey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. - Reid Hoffman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun times. We have to re-shoot our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LKcY8Ek98s&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; because the hdd crashed and we lost all the footage. I also did my 1st &lt;a href=&quot;http://buff.ly/1zi1My7&quot;&gt;info-graphic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I have some plans on stripping the features and design for a new version. However, I am not sure if it will be worth the effort. And I have other priorities...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few pics from my 1st off-road attempt with the Yamaha TW200. It's a simple trail, just to test out the bike. I will attempt again in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I have started working, I realise there's a need for &lt;a href=&quot;/categories/miniescapades/&quot;&gt;mini escapades&lt;/a&gt; to recharge oneself. I don't mean expensive, long, exotic travels, but escapades that can be close to home, cheap, simple, short and yet very effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to document my escapades down in hope of encouraging people to get outside of their comfort zone, go somewhere they've never been, go on a mini adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I aim to achieve an escapade once a month. With these escapades build up gradually, I hope inspire more to start on their own mini escapades.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Batch generate thumbnails using Image Magick</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/imagemagick/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Batch generate thumbnails using Image Magick" /><published>2013-07-17T23:06:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-07-17T23:06:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/imagemagick</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/imagemagick/">&lt;p&gt;I was helping to populate content, only to realise the system wasn't smart enough to generate its own thumbnails. Someone told me to screenshot the 1st page of each pdf and then upload the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an utterly waste of time. Hence, I decided to write something to batch generate thumbnails using Image Magick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the command below to generate 100 pixels wide image from the sample.pdf. the [0] means 1st page. You can select the page you want by inputing the page number - 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;convert -thumbnail 100x sample.pdf[0] sample.png&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can combine them with any PHP, Django script. I'm lazy so I use my Mac's Automator to batch execute it. You can also use the bash command below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;for file in *.pdf; do convert $file[0] -thumbnail 100x -quality 85 -background white -flatten $file-tn.jpg; done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was helping to populate content, only to realise the system wasn't smart enough to generate its own thumbnails.
