  Current Involvement.
</h1>
<h5>
  Senior Project Manager, Minitheory
</h5>
<p>
  As I recollect how <a href="https://twitter.com/slidbook" target="new">Michael Chen</a> poach me to join Minitheory, it was amusing and yet a great opportunity. We work on multi-countries e-commerce sites, a suite of manufacturing execution system, an online insurance broker, concepts for storm water management system and multiple mobile apps; these are a few things we've made simpler by designing based on how people think and behave.
<br/><br/>
  I'm learning how to apply user research techniques coupled with influences from cognitive psychology.

<h5>
  Volunteer with Singapore Geek Girls
</h5>
<p>
  A local volunteer-based <a href="https://www.meetup.com/singapore-geekgirls/" target="new">initiative</a> that serves as a platform for females to connect, share, contribute, mentor and learn from each other.
<br/><br/>
  I'm learning how to better organise and plan events/activties.
</p>
<h5>
  Volunteer with Engineers.SG
</h5>
<p>
  <a href="https://engineers.sg/" target="new">Engineers.SG</a> is a not-for-profit community initiative created to help document the Singapore tech and startup scene. Helping to capture the videos has re-ignite my passion in production work back then leading the group "Production Crew" as part of my co-curriculum activities in Temasek Polytechnic.
<br/><br/>
  I'm learning how to better capture and document stories.
