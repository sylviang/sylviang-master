From Nov 2013 to Apr 2014, I am working on my 1st mobile app side project on top of my full-time job. Made [Motoqlik](http://motoqlik.com) with Brandon and friends. It is a motorists social app that we would like to refer to as a revolutionary way for motorists to connect.

I have neglected it since and rather early this month, the app has launched on both [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motoqlik/id882273536) and [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.motoqlik.app).

I’m kinda embarrassed about it. But hey!

Fun times. We have to re-shoot our [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LKcY8Ek98s) because the hdd crashed and we lost all the footage. I also did my 1st [info-graphic](http://buff.ly/1zi1My7).

Now, I have some plans on stripping the features and design for a new version. However, I am not sure if it will be worth the effort. And I have other priorities...
