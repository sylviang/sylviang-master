Increasingly, companies have finally adopted responsive website design. To me, this is not a trend but a necessity; given how smartphones and tablets affects one's life. 

In the past, companies created multiple versions of their websites for mobile users. This is not practical hence responsive design approach saves the day. Although responsive website design has been in the scene for many years, I realised that there are some people who are still confuse between mobile sites and responsive sites.

The basic instinct is to use media queries or css frameworks out there. Depending on the project requirements, here are some options worth considering, [skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/), [wirefy](http://cjdsie.github.com/wirefy), [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com), [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), [1140 css grid](http://cssgrid.net/), [frameless](http://framelessgrid.com).
