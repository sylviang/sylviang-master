1. The watch is a great complement to my huge ass iPhone 6+. The phone is so bulky that I left it lying around not within reach, or it is kept inside the bag. But my work requires me to response to important messages immediately. When I am waiting or expecting something, instead of having to check my phone every now and then, the notifications and alerts on my wrist tells me if it's what I am expecting. 

2. Battery life is decent. A habit of mine is to wear the watch all day even when I am at sleep or in shower. Now that I have to take it out to charge at the end-of-the-day, I think sleep better and more comfortable.

3. I silent my phone most of the time and I do not turn on the vibrations because it can be irritating when the phone is vibrating on the desk. At work, I do get call alerts and iMessages on my laptop. But when I am away from desk, the prominent haptic allow me to know when I am about to receive something.

4. I never scroll with the crown. Using finger scroll works just as well. Maybe I am used to it.

5. I love that I get rewarded for activity goals. Not much, but still it is some encouragement.

6. I feel like a fool when I take phone calls from the watch. The speaker is too soft. However, I enjoy texting. It is a quick and easy way to send text messages but weird user experience of having to select the receiver's name and press send.

7. GPS is good. However, when I am riding on my motorbike, I could see the map directions through glances but could not feel the vibrations. Probably due to the crazy vibrations from my dual-purpose scrambler-looking motorbike. Apple maps seems fine for now.

I can't wait for the next release. :)
