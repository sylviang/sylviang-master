I have very few watches. If I'm meeting people, I put on the fancier or interesting ones. But for most of the time I wore those crappy ones as I am really careless. They were mostly there to tell the time. 

**7 things about the Apple Watch. **

1. The watch is a great complement to my huge ass iPhone 6+. It's so bulky that I mostly left it lying around not within reach, or kept it in the bag. But my work requires me to response to important messages from client. I need to be on the ball. But now I can keep my phone in the bag and reply only if needed.

2. Battery life is decent. A habit of mine is to wear the watch all day even at sleep and shower. Now that I have to take it out to charge at the end-of-the-day. I think sleep better and more comfortable.

3. I silent my phone most of the time and I do not turn on the vibrations because it can be irritating when the phone is vibrating on the desk. At work, I do get call alerts and iMessages on laptop. But when I am away from desk, the prominent haptic allow me to know when I am about to receive something.

4. I never scroll with the crown. Using finger scroll works just as well. Maybe I am used to it.

5. I love that I get rewarded for activity goals. Not much, but still some encouragement.

6. I feel like a fool when taking phone calls from the watch. The speaker is too soft. However, I enjoy texting.  It is quick and easy but weird having to select the name and press send.

7. GPS is good. However, when I am riding on my motorbike, I can see the directions but due to the vibrations of my dual-purpose scrambler-looking motorbike, I could not feel the vibrations. I saved money for a phone holder mount on the bike. Apple maps seems fine for now.

I can't wait for the next release. :)
