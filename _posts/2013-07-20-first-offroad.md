A few pics from my 1st off-road attempt with the Yamaha TW200. It's a simple trail, just to test out the bike. I will attempt again in the day.

Ever since I have started working, I realise there's a need for [mini escapades](/categories/miniescapades/) to recharge oneself. I don't mean expensive, long, exotic travels, but escapades that can be close to home, cheap, simple, short and yet very effective.

I decided to document my escapades down in hope of encouraging people to get outside of their comfort zone, go somewhere they've never been, go on a mini adventure.

I aim to achieve an escapade once a month. With these escapades build up gradually, I hope inspire more to start on their own mini escapades.
