We all knew about the PSD-to-HTML workflow but with the introduction of Responsive Web Design (RWD), the workflow has to change. 

Given the complexity of RWD, initial planning like content strategy, IA, sketching, prototyping without considering layout changes and alternate viewports may cause opportunities for optimization and innovation to be overlooked.

Also, we can't be producing PSD for each page and/or view variations, it's crazy. 

Hence, a new appproach is required. 

1. Rethink the internal process with [Trent Walton's Where to Start](http://trentwalton.com/2013/02/07/where-to-start). There's an interesting point on browser-centric workflows & style guides being the future. Apparently, many have been talking about [designing in the browser](http://andysearles.com/designing-in-the-browser).<sup id="fnref:DIB"><a href="#fn:DIB" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

2. Improve on how we craft webpages and the deliverables produced with [Dave Rupert's Responsive Deliverables](http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables). This article tells us to break complex page layouts into reusable solutions in terms of modules.

Learning and self-improvement has always been a part of me. And one needs to proactively embrace new approaches than try to shoehorn an old one.
