“Common sense is the most widely shared commodity in the world, for every man is convinced that he is well supplied with it.” ― René Descartes

Isn't most things in life strikes us as common sense? Or at least, that is what I thought so, same for many others. But common sense is not so common.

Common sense "should" be the root of all analysis. However, common sense is highly subjective and requires definition. Many people see things differently, think differently and thus doing things differently with reasons behind it. And I do think it's rude when one says "Use your common sense".
