I can't wait to attend the 3 days Scrum Master Certification by ISS. Ever since I was first introduced to SCRUM, I've been trying to practice it. 

However, I din't really get the chance to practice it fully as the companies I've worked in are very much following the old "Waterfall Model". And I also believe they are not ready to work with SCRUM yet.

But I have been slowly applying SCRUM principles and techniques into the process, skipping the terminologies and all, hoping to get them comfortable and one day they will realised "Oh, we're actually using SCRUM." --if they actually know what it is.

With this certification, I hope to encourage people the best practices of SCRUM and to particpate in a SCRUM team that appreciates it.
