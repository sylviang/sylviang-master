So, I decided to start a personal blog. Hopefully, this will help to keep my thoughts, improve on my english and writing.

>This site is built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a simple, blog aware, static site generator with the responsive site methodology in mind. It is hosted on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Source code is on [Github](https://github.com/sylviang). The typeset is Arvo & Merriweather from [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts).
