title: Force Jekyll to use a specific timezone

I just realised from the post output that the timestamps are screwed up. I am puzzled. Knowing it must be some timezone issue, but I have no idea what is wrong.

Anyway, for the interim, i'll generate the site with a specific timezone. Use the command below.

	TZ=UTC jekyll --server
